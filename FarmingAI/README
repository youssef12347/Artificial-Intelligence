This is FARMING AI. An Application that runs on tkinter python. 

Users input their soil conditions such as: temperature, humidity, rainfall, NPK and pH. 

The XGBoost algorithm which is linked to the Kaggle Dataset, outputs the ideal/optimal crop to plant based on those conditions. 

The GUI implementation showcases the results as pictures on the right hand side after pushing the "FARM!" button. 

For efficiency reasons, the model training is saved in a joblib (pickle) file. And loaded when needed.

Feel free to input your own farming characteristics and Enjoy the App!
